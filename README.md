forts自动准备(Forst Automatic preparation)
=
**这个程序可以自动按照用户指定的识别间隔，用opencv识别屏幕上的“开始”“下载”“准备”按钮并自动移动鼠标点击，方便有事的时候暂时离开由程序负责开始游戏和准备，防止被踢出房间
使用ai搭配pycharm写的，陈余代码和小bug没修
我已打包好的程序是forts自动准备.exe**

**This program can automatically identify the "Start", "Download" and "Prepare" buttons on the screen at the intervals specified by the user using OpenCV, and automatically move the mouse to click them. This is convenient for users to temporarily leave while the program takes care of starting the game and preparing, preventing being kicked out of the room.
The program was written using AI and PyCharm, and Chen Yu's code and minor bugs have not been fixed.
The packaged program I have is "forts automatic preparation.exe""**
