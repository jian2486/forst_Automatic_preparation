forts自动准备(forst_auto_setout)
=
**这个程序可以自动按照用户指定的识别间隔，用opencv识别屏幕上的“开始”“下载”“准备”按钮并自动移动鼠标点击，方便有事的时候暂时离开由程序负责开始游戏和准备，防止被踢出房间
但是当前有些问题比如可能无法识别到透明以及超小的下载按钮，识别参数的问题，可以自行尝试修改和构建
使用ai搭配pycharm写的，陈余代码和小bug没修
我已打包好的程序是forts自动准备.exe**

**This program can automatically, according to the user-specified recognition interval, use OpenCV to identify the "Start", "Download" and "Prepare" buttons on the screen and automatically move the mouse to click them. This is convenient for users to temporarily leave while the program is responsible for starting the game and preparing, preventing being kicked out of the room.
However, there are some current issues such as the inability to recognize transparent and extremely small download buttons, as well as problems with the recognition parameters. These can be attempted to be modified and constructed by oneself.
The program was written using AI and PyCharm. The minor bugs have not been fixed.The program that I have prepared is "forts自动准备.exe"**
